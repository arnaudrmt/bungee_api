## Key Features üåü

- **Server-wide Whitelist**: BungeeAPI includes a built-in server-wide whitelist functionality.

This feature ensures centralized control over player access and simplifies the management of server-wide restrictions.

- **Server-wide Friends System**: BungeeAPI implements a must-have feature on Minecraft servers ‚Äì a server-wide friends system. Players can add, remove, manage, and direct message their friends from anywhere within the server. This functionality enhances social interactions and fosters a sense of community among players.

When players are part of the same party, they are automatically teleported together to game servers. This seamless integration ensures that friends can easily join each other in multiplayer games, enhancing cooperative gameplay experiences.

- **Integration with OctanaAPI**: BungeeAPI works in conjunction with OctanaAPI to optimize server interactions. When a party attempts to join a game that requires a specific number of players, OctanaAPI communicates with BungeeAPI to enforce the game's requirements. This integration ensures a balanced and fair gaming environment while playing with friends.
